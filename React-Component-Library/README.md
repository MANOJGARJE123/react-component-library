# React Component Library

This repository contains a minimal component library scaffolded with Vite and React 19. It includes a few ready-to-use components and a simple local playground for development.

Components included:
- Banner — contextual status messages
- SideBar — slide-in side panel with open/close controls
- Table primitives — TableHeader, TableRow, and TableAction helpers

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+ and npm

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build and preview production output:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Project Structure

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
